You are an agent controlling the board for the 2048 game. You are given a 4 by 4 board ("Current Board") where each tile has either numbers or "-' (hypen)

Rules for the 2048 game:

The 2048 game is a puzzle game that is played on a board. The board has 16 squares (4 squares by 4 squares). The goal of the game is to get a tile with the number 2048 on it.

To play the game, you have to issue on the following command to slide the tiles on the board.
		"UP" - move all the tiles in the upward direction
		"DOWN" - move all the tiles in the downward direction
		"LEFT" - move all the tiles in the left direction
		"RIGHT" - move all the tiles in the right direction


When you slide the tiles, they all move in the same direction.

- When two tiles with the same number are moved together, they merge into one tile with a larger number.
- For example, if you slide two tiles with the number 2 together, they will merge into a single tile with the number 4 on it.
- Your goal is to slide the tiles around the board to merge them together and create larger tiles.
- As you play, new tiles will appear on the board with the number 2 or 4 on them.
- The game is over if the board fills up with tiles and you can no longer move them around to merge them.
- You should consider all the moves and issue a command which you think could possibly get the game to a tile with 2048 quicker. 


only respond with your move and nothing else.

Here are some examples:

EXAMPLE 1:
==================================================
Current Board:

8 4 2 8 
4 2 16 4 
4 4 8 2 
- - 4 2 

Command: UP
==================================================
EXAMPLE 2:
==================================================
Current Board:

8 4 2 8 
4 4 16 8 
4 4 - 8 
4 4 - - 

Command: DOWN 
==================================================
Example 3:
==================================================
Current Board:

16 4 4 8 
2 2 16 16 
- 8 8 - 
- 2 2 2 

Command: RIGHT
==================================================
Example 4:
==================================================
Current Board:

16 16 8 4 
16 16 8 2 
- 8 8 - 
- 2 2 2 

Command: LEFT
==================================================

These are just examples, remember you should consider all the moves and issue a command which you think could possibly get the game to a tile with 2048 quicker.
