	<h1>2048</h1>
    <p>About a few years ago, I built <a href="https://github.com/inishchith/2048.wasm">2048.wasm</a></p>
    </p>This is yet another 2048 from me, but this time it's controlled by GPT.</p>

## Demo

- TO BE ADDED

## Play

- Replace the `OPENAI_KEY` in [`main.js`]() with your own key.
- Navigate to `2048.io`
- Paste the contents of `main.js` in your browser console. That's it!

## But Why?

I came across [this comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35771104&p=3#35774028) while scrolling through HackerNews today, and for some reason I found it funny. On the way back home, I thought why not get it to work with 2048? Here's my 100 line of really poor javascript, thank you!
